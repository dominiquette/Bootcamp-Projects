## 👩🏽‍💻 🅰🅱🅾🆄🆃 🅼🅴

Hello! 👋🏽  

I am ***Dominique*** 

**My Hobbies:** 
Skipping 𓀫 | Gym🏋🏽 | Cooking👩🏻‍🍳 | Coding💻

Here are some projects I worked on during my bootcamp.
Feel free to explore the different projects in each folder!

## 🎨 Art-Workshop:
This project is a database system designed to help my friend's art workshop centre run more smoothly. The centre offers creative classes for children aged 4-11, and this system helps manage workshop schedules, enrolments, feedback, and memberships.

The goal is to organise data efficiently, making it easier to track enrolments, collect feedback, and improve decision-making. With this SQL database, the centre can provide a better experience for young artists and their families.


## 🎉Kids Party Booking:
The Kids Party Booking API is a system designed to streamline the process of booking children's parties. It allows users to check availability, make bookings, and manage reservations through a MySQL database. Built with Flask, the API handles customer details, party themes, and scheduling, making it easier to organise and track bookings efficiently.


## ⭐ Star Wars Game ⭐
This is a Star Wars-themed word game that uses the Star Wars API to fetch character data. The game scrambles a character's name, and players must guess the correct name. They can request clues or give up, and their score is recorded for future reference. Built with Python, the game offers a fun and interactive way to test Star Wars knowledge.






## 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭

In this assignment, I will be using GitHub to:
- *Make a private repositary* 
- *A Read Me file with at least 6 different markdown texts*

Another file of my choice, demonstrate:
- *Checking the status*
- *Creating a branch*
- *Adding files to the branch*
- *Adding commits with meaningful messages*
- *Opening a pull request*
- *Merging and deploying to main branch*


I'm using GitHub for this assignment because it's a powerful tool for version control and collaboration. It allows me to track changes to my projects, work on new features without affecting the main version and collaborate with my classmates and instructors.


## 𝐎𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐬
- [.gitignore:](.gitignore) This file is a ***.gitignore*** file
  
  - A *'.gitignore'* file, tells Git which files and directories to ignore. This helps preventing irrelevant files that you dont want to be shown, included or being tracked in your Git repository. This helps keep your repository clean and prevents you from accidently committing sensitive files such as passwords or any other irrelevant files.

- [requirements.txt:](requirements.txt) This file is a ***requirements.txt*** file

  - A *'requirements.txt'* file, lists all the Python packages needed for a Python project to run.
