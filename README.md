**My Hobbies:**

**Tech Skills:**
Python, VsCode, PyCharm

## 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭

In this assignment, I will be using GitHub to:
- *Make a private repositary* 
- *A Read Me file with at least 6 different markdown texts*

Another file of my choice, demonstrate:
- *Checking the status*
- *Creating a branch*
- *Adding files to the branch*
- *Adding commits with meaningful messages*
- *Opening a pull request*
- *Merging and deploying to main branch*


I'm using GitHub for this assignment because it's a powerful tool for version control and collaboration. It allows me to track changes to my projects, work on new features without affecting the main version, and collaborate with my classmates and instructors.
